"""Defences for text written by other people (mail, invitations, notes, files) before it reaches a model.

Two things, both cheap and deliberately conservative:

- Invisible characters a reader cannot see are removed: Unicode tag characters (which can smuggle whole sentences),
  zero-width spaces and invisible operators, and the direction overrides/isolates that make text display in a different
  order than a model reads it. Left-to-right/right-to-left marks and zero-width (non-)joiners stay, because Kurdish,
  Persian and Arabic text and emoji sequences rely on them.
- Text that looks like an attempt to steer the agent, or asks to change bank or payment details, gets a plain-language
  warning next to it. The warning is a hint for the model and the owner, not a filter: nothing is removed or blocked.
