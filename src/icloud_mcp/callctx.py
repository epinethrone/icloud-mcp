"""What the tool call running on this thread is doing, and the one retry policy.

stage(): services name the step in progress ("IMAP SEARCH in Archive"), so a call that times out can say which step was slow.
The tool wrapper hands each call a fresh holder; the event loop reads it when the timeout fires.

retry_once_if_safe(): retry a call ONCE, and only when all of these hold:
  * the failure is the connection, not the request (a dead socket, a dropped TLS session, a timeout);
  * the connection was a reused one from a pool (a brand-new connection that fails is a real failure);
  * nothing was written yet on this call (after a STORE, APPEND, EXPUNGE, PUT, DELETE or SMTP send the write may have landed,
    and repeating it could duplicate or double-delete).
The retry always uses a brand-new connection. Services record "reused" and "mutated" on the per-call state below.
